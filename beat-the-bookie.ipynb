Rather than compete with the bookmakers predictions, Kunitz et al. attempt to beat the bookmakers by using their predictions against them. In the paper, they demonstrate how to take advantage of mispriced odds using the implicit information in boomakers' aggreagete odds and conclude it is possible. Bookmakers countered the authors success by limiting the size and type of bets they were allowed to place, leading to the second conclusion of the paper: even if a bettor has a consistently profitable strategy, the bookies are under no obligation to continue taking his or her bets. Betting exchanges use discriminatory practices against successful gamblers and online sports betting remains a long-term losing proposition.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Lisandro79/BeatTheBookie/tree/master/src\n\nPaper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320296375_Beating_the_bookies_with_their_own_numbers_-_and_how_the_online_sports_betting_market_is_rigged\n\nBlog: https://www.lisandrokaunitz.com/index.php/en/category/beatthebookies-en/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport gzip\nimport shutil\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 5)\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.096567Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.097534Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.954436Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.097497Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.953247Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Unzip data into Kaggle notebook's working directory\nPATH = \"../input/beat-the-bookie-worldwide-football-dataset/\"\n\nfor fname in ['closing_odds', 'odds_series', 'odds_series_b',\n             'odds_series_b_matches', 'odds_series_matches']:\n    with gzip.open(PATH + f'{fname}.csv.gz', 'rb') as f_in:\n        with open(f'./{fname}.csv', 'wb') as f_out:\n            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.956073Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.956936Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T02:14:05.387969Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T02:13:49.956899Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T02:14:05.386929Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Matches with odds and bookie data.\nclose = pd.read_csv('./closing_odds.csv', index_col=0)\n\n#utf-8 encoder won't work here\nseries_b_match = pd.read_csv('./odds_series_b_matches.csv', index_col=0, encoding='latin-1')\nseries_match = pd.read_csv('./odds_series_matches.csv', index_col=0, encoding='latin-1')\n\n#Big files!\nseries = pd.read_csv('./odds_series.csv', index_col=0,  nrows=1000)\nseries_b = pd.read_csv('./odds_series_b.csv', index_col=0, nrows=1000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T02:14:05.389574Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T02:14:05.390303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T02:14:13.245347Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T02:14:05.390272Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T02:14:13.244057Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploration\n\nKaunitz, et al. collected historical closing odds of 479,440 soccer matches between 2005 and 2015 from 32 online bookmakers.

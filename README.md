# Greenhouse Gas Concentrations

Th University of Melbourne offers comprehensive, interactive plots, factsheets and data download options for atmospheric surface concentrations of 43 greenhouse gases and 3 equivalent gas time series from 2000 years ago to the year 2500.

The compilation of observational data merges multiple data sources whilst maintaining latitudinal and seasonal information. Clearly, without the multi-decadal efforts by the flask and insitu measurements by the NOAA and the AGAGE networks, this compilation would not have been possible. Those measurement networks are the backbone of our knowledge on recent greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere - in conjunction with centuries of ice core and firn data.

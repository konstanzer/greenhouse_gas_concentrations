#⚾ Finding a Profitable Baseball Betting Algorithm ⚾

My favorite team, the New York Yankees, was eliminated by their rival, the Boston Red Sox, in this year's American League wildcard game. Normally, when the Yankees season ends, I lose interest in the rest of the season but what if I raised the stakes, and thereby my interest, by placing small bets on the outcomes of the remaining games? Furthermore, what if I used my knowledge of baseball and data science to design an algorithm that would be profitable in the long-run? These were the questions that began this project.

Betting algorithms are programs designed to identify profitable betting opportunities — either **value** bets or **arbitrage** bets — by analyzing large amounts of data. 

* **Value betting algorithms** are the commonest type of betting algorithm. These algorithms collect data from thousands of past sporting matches, estimate the probability of bettable outcomes, and identify bookmakers offering odds on those outcomes that seem favorable. Finding value bets boils down to finding bets with an **expected value** greater than the stake or wager of the bet. The expected value can be thought of as the average profit or loss you would make on the bet if you made if many times over.

* **Arbitrage betting algorithms** take advantage of mismatched or patterned odds for a certain sporting outcome. It happens when a better can place a bet at favorable odds and then place a bet against his original bet (thereby guaranteeing a profit) once the odds have moved. They place no importance on calculating the probability of sporting outcomes. Instead, they look for patterns in odds within or between betting exchanges.

Generating the tip is only the first part. The second is determining the appropriate bet size, also called **bankroll management**.  Since you can't be 100% sure that any single bet will be correct, you can't risk too much of your portfolio on any one bet. Bankroll management isn't just about placing small bets relative to your bankroll but also adapting bet size to the probability of an outcome. If an outcome is very likely, an algorithm may wager more.

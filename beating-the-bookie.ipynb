Rather than compete with the bookmakers predictions, Kunitz et al. attempt to beat the bookmakers by using their predictions against them. In the paper, they demonstrate how to take advantage of mispriced odds using the implicit information in boomakers' aggreagete odds and conclude it is possible. Bookmakers countered the authors success by limiting the size and type of bets they were allowed to place, leading to the second conclusion of the paper: even if a bettor has a consistently profitable strategy, the bookies are under no obligation to continue taking his or her bets. Betting exchanges use discriminatory practices against successful gamblers and online sports betting remains a long-term losing proposition.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Lisandro79/BeatTheBookie/tree/master/src\n\nPaper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320296375_Beating_the_bookies_with_their_own_numbers_-_and_how_the_online_sports_betting_market_is_rigged\n\nBlog: https://www.lisandrokaunitz.com/index.php/en/category/beatthebookies-en/\n\n### Summary \n\nOriginally, I intended to create a value betting algorithm for this project but Kaunitz, et al. convinced me it was a bad idea for the simple reason that my model would have to predict the probability of sporting events better than the bookmakers' models - and making a good models is their whole business. Furthermore, I can aggregate there guesses to make mine and bypass the data and computationally-expensive process of analyzing teams and players.\n\nThis notebook represents my best attempt to recreate such a model using the same soccer match data.
